# CreatorFunds — "Here's to the Creators"

## Overview
A bold, animated storytelling landing page for CreatorFunds.org — an influencer-brand matching agency that creates a fund to help smaller creators get deals while matching larger creators with premium brands.

Inspired by Apple's legendary "Think Different" campaign, this page tells the story of creators as the new change-makers.

## 🎨 Image Prompts

### 1. Hero/Creator Spark (`creator-spark.png`)
**Use for**: Section 2 - The Dreamers

```
A single glowing spark or flame held in cupped hands, representing the birth of an idea. 
Style: Ethereal, soft glow, gradient from warm coral (#FF6B6B) to electric purple (#8B5CF6).
Background: Pure white or very light gradient.
Mood: Hopeful, warm, intimate.
Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)
Details: Hands should be diverse/ambiguous, focus on the light emanating from between fingers, 
subtle particles or sparkles rising upward, photorealistic hands with stylized magical light.
```

**Alternative prompt (more abstract):**
```
Abstract visualization of creative potential — a luminous orb with swirling colors 
(coral, gold, purple, mint) surrounded by floating geometric particles. 
Minimalist, clean composition on white background. 
Style: Modern 3D render, soft shadows, glass-like texture on orb.
```

---

### 2. Creator Fund (`creator-fund.png`)
**Use for**: Section 5 - The Fund Concept

```
A small seedling or plant growing from coins/currency, bathed in golden morning light.
Style: Warm, optimistic, growth metaphor.
Colors: Gold (#F59E0B) accents, fresh green (#10B981), soft cream background.
Mood: Investment that grows, nurturing potential.
Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)
Details: The plant should look young but healthy, maybe 2-3 leaves. 
Coins should be subtle, not garish. Perhaps mixed currencies to suggest global reach.
Soft bokeh in background, editorial photography style.
```

**Alternative prompt (more conceptual):**
```
Abstract representation of a fund — multiple small circles (representing creators) 
connected by glowing lines to a central larger circle (the fund), 
with some circles ascending/growing larger.
Style: Modern infographic meets fine art, gradient mesh background (gold to mint).
Clean, geometric, but with organic flow in the connecting lines.
```

---

### 3. Creator Collective / Tapestry (`creator-collective.png`)
**Use for**: Section 8 - The Collective

```
A beautiful woven tapestry visualization — many threads of different colors 
(coral, gold, purple, mint, blue, pink) coming together to form a cohesive pattern.
Each thread represents a different creator voice.
Style: Abstract but warm, textile-inspired digital art.
Colors: Full brand palette woven together harmoniously.
Mood: Unity in diversity, collective strength, collaborative beauty.
Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)
Details: Some threads should be thinner (smaller creators), some thicker (bigger creators),
but all contribute equally to the final pattern. Subtle shimmer/glow where threads intersect.
```

**Alternative prompt (more human):**
```
An aerial view of diverse people standing in a circle, holding hands or linking arms,
shot from directly above. Each person casts a colorful shadow in brand colors.
The shadows overlap and blend where people connect, creating a kaleidoscope effect.
Style: Modern photography meets digital art, soft lighting.
Figures are abstract/silhouetted, focus on the connection and color interplay.
```

**Alternative prompt (abstract):**
```
A constellation of glowing orbs of varying sizes, all connected by delicate 
luminous threads. The orbs pulse gently, and the connections brighten when 
multiple orbs are linked. Smaller orbs are just as connected as larger ones.
Style: 3D render, dark background with vibrant gradient colors.
Represents the idea that everyone is equal in the network regardless of size.
```

## 🖼️ Optional Hero Background
If you want a full-bleed background behind the hero:

```
Abstract fluid gradient art, dreamlike flowing colors merging and separating.
Colors: Coral (#FF6B6B), hot pink (#EC4899), purple (#8B5CF6), hints of electric blue (#4F46E5).
Style: Silk-like texture, soft organic shapes, no hard edges.
Very soft, low contrast — designed to sit behind text.
Resolution: 3840x2160 minimum.
Opacity suggestion: Use at 10-20% opacity in CSS.
```

## 🎬 Optional Video Prompts (for future enhancement)

### Background Loop
```
Abstract flowing gradients animation, smooth color transitions between coral, 
pink, purple, and blue. Silk or liquid texture, slow movement (5-10 second loop).
Seamless loop, 4K, 24fps, no audio.
```

### Creator Testimonial B-Roll
```
Diverse creators in their element: filming YouTube videos, editing on laptops 
in cafes, streaming games, taking photos on city streets.
Style: Documentary, warm color grade, shallow depth of field.
Quick cuts, 2-3 seconds each. Upbeat but not chaotic.
```
